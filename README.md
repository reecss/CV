# Hi, I'm Reece.

I'm a back-to-front end developer from Barnsley, South Yorkshire. I have an unbounded desire to learn new skills and constantly improve and expand my skillset to make websites that are a pleasure to experience and use.

Over the past 3 years working as a web developer at A Shade Greener Ltd (2 as junior, 1 as lead) I've worked on every aspect of web development, from the server to the browser.

## I Do Front-end
I strive to write fast, clean, semantic HTML5 backed up with responsive CSS3 style enhancements which gracefully fall back to working solutions in older browsers. I write modular, structured BEM-style CSS compiled with Sass and Compass, and I have knowledge of CSS frameworks such as Foundation and Bootstrap.

And what good is a fancy looking website without a little user interaction? I'm proficient at creating web components and widgets using low-impact, cross-browser and cross-device compatible JavaScript/jQuery. I also have plans for a personal project utilising the Angular javascript framework to create a single page application.

### Skills
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Sass & Compass
- CSS Frameworks
	- Foundation
	- Neat
- JavaScript/jQuery
- AJAX
- Responsive
- Compatibility

## I Do Back-end
As well as being adept at front-end development, I'm also experienced in writing server code with PHP. I've been responsible for database design, file architecture and writing the majority of back-end code for most of the projects I've worked on.

I work with object-oriented PHP on a daily basis - both in standard format and using an MVC pattern with the Slim microframework - writing DRY, abstracted code which is well commented and meets PSR-2 standards, so it's easy to read and simple to refactor.

### Skills
- Object-oriented PHP
- MySQL
- MVC
- Frameworks
	- Laravel
	- Slim modified for MVC
	- Some Kohana use
- M/WAMP
- Template Engines
- SSH

## I Have Experience
In the last 3 years I've worked on several websites and projects across the A Shade Greener family. In this time I've taken on a variety of assignments and played a vital role at the company.

I'm responsible for maintaining and updating all websites across the ASG family. I take part in weekly marketing meetings to contribute to upcoming marketing ideas, working with the Marketing Manager and Design Team to come up with ideas to increase customer applications.

Working on a number of ongoing projects means teamwork and time management are essential. I work with our junior developer to assign tasks appropriately and ensure work is completed to deadlines, utilising Git for version control and Bitbucket for code collaboration.

*Which will actually work soon.

## I'm a [Real Human Being](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSVDcw6iW8)
When I'm not coding I spend most of my time playing videos games, listening to music or trawling the internet for the latest tech news, science updates and stuff that's generally interesting to read or watch.

I have an unhealthy obsession with watches and I'm slowly building a record collection.
