# Hi, I'm Reece.

I'm a back-to-front end developer from Barnsley, South Yorkshire. I have an unbounded desire to learn new skills and constantly improve and expand my skillset to make websites that are a pleasure to experience and use.

Over the past 3 years working as a web developer at A Shade Greener Ltd (2 as junior, 1 as lead) I've worked on every aspect of web development, from the server to the browser.

## I Do Front-end
I strive to write fast, clean, semantic HTLM5 backed up with CSS3 style enhancements which gracefully fall back to working solutions in older browsers. I write modular, structured BEM-style CSS compiled with Sass and Compass and have knowledge of CSS frameworks such as Foundation and Bootstrap.

And what good is a fancy looking website without a little user interaction? I'm proficient at creating web components and widgets using low-impact, cross-browser and cross-device compatible JavaScript/jQuery.

### Skills
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Sass)
- Compass
- Bourbon
- Played around with CSS frameworks (Neat, Foundation) and structures (MVCSS)
- JS/jQuery
- AJAX
- Dabbled with Backbone, Angular
- Progressive enhancement
- Cross/backwards compatibility

## I Do Back-end
As well as being adept at front-end development, I'm also experienced in writing server code with PHP. I've been responsible for database design, file architecture and writing the majority of back-end code for most of the projects I've worked on.

I work with object-oriented PHP on a daily basis - both in standard format and using an MVC pattern with the Slim microframework - writing DRY, abstracted code which is well commented and meets PSR-2 standards, so it's easy to read and simple to refactor.

### Skills
- Object-oriented PHP
- MySQL
- MVC
- Frameworks
	- Slim modified for MVC
	- Some Kohana use
	- Some Laravel knowledge
- M/WAMP
- Template Engines
- SSH

^ change this to youtu.be. Also find a better quality one. Maybe go straight to the chorus?

I play video games, read about code, technology, psychology. TED talks are interesting.
