# Hi, I'm Reece.

I'm a back-to-front end developer from Barnsley, South Yorkshire. I have an unbounded desire to learn new skills and constantly improve and expand my skillset to make websites that are a pleasure to experience and use.

Over the past 3 years working as a web developer at A Shade Greener Ltd (2 as junior, 1 as lead) I've worked on every aspect of web development, from the server to the browser.


## I Do Front-end
I strive to write fast, clean, semantic HTLM5 backed up with CSS3 style enhancements which gracefully fall back to working solutions in older browsers. I write modular, structured BEM-style CSS compiled with Sass and Compass and have knowledge of CSS frameworks such as Foundation and Bootstrap.

And what good is a fancy looking website without a little user interaction? I'm proficient at creating web components and widgets using low-impact, cross-browser and cross-device compatible JavaScript/jQuery.

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Sass)
- Compass
- Bourbon
- Played around with CSS frameworks (Neat, Foundation) and structures (MVCSS)
- JS/jQuery
- Dabbled with Backbone, Angular
- Progressive enhancement
- Cross/backwards compatibility

## I Do Back-end
While I primarily see myself as a front-end developer, I'm also experienced in writing server code with PHP. I've been responsible for database design, file architecture and writing the majority of back-end code for most of the projects I've worked on.

I primarily work with object-oriented PHP written to PSR-2 standards

- PHP (OOP)
- Frameworks
	- Slim modified for MVC
	- Some Kohana use
	- Some Laravel knowledge
- MySQL

## Stuff I've done
- ASG Redesign
- Initial work on EVLB
- ASG Money Backend
- Initial work on ASG Biomass
- Management/optimisation on main ASG site (improving application process etc.) - front- and back-end
- Plans to build CRM for EVLB using a JS framework
- Built several scripts/macros to make repetitive tasks in other departments more efficient (part of the reason I looked into Python)


## Other Skills
- Git
- Automated task running via CodeKit (transitioning to Grunt/Gulp)
- Some Python knowledge

## Currently Leaning
- Angular
- Karma/Jasmine
- Laravel

I'm currently checking out JavaScript frameworks for creating single page webapps and have plans to start a personal project using Angular in the near future.


## Me
I play video games, read about code, technology, psychology. TED talks are interesting.
