# Hi, I'm Reece.

I'm a full stack web developer from Barnsley, South Yorkshire. I have an
unbounded desire to learn new skills and constantly improve and expand my
skillset to make websites that are a pleasure to experience and use.

Over the past 7 years I've progressed from an in-house junior developer to a
senior position with the responsibility and trust to make technical project
decisions and produce proposals for client work. During this time I've taught
myself every aspect of web development, from the server to the browser.

---

## I Do Front-end
I strive to write fast, clean, semantic HTML5 backed up with responsive CSS3
style enhancements which gracefully fall back to working solutions in older
browsers. I write modular, structured BEM-style CSS compiled with Sass, and I
have knowledge of CSS frameworks such as Foundation and Bootstrap.

And what good is a fancy looking website without a little user interaction? I'm
proficient at creating web components and widgets using low-impact,
cross-browser and cross-device compatible JavaScript/jQuery, with some knowledge
of javascript frameworks for seamless single-page applications.

I'm currently looking at adding React to my list of skills, so I'm working
through a course covering React, Redux, Firebase, Webpack and more in order to
learn the React stack and its related tools.

### Skills
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Sass
- CSS Frameworks
    - Foundation
    - Bootstrap
- JavaScript/jQuery
- Vue.js framework
- AJAX
- Responsiveness
- Compatibility
- Responsive Emails

## I Do Back-end
As well as being adept at front-end development, I'm well-versed in writing
server code with PHP. I've been responsible for database schema design,
file architecture and writing the majority of back-end code for most of the
projects I've worked on.

I work with object-oriented PHP on a daily basis - both in standard format and
using the Laravel framework - writing DRY, abstracted code which is well
commented and meets PSR-2 standards, so it's easy to read and simple to
refactor.

### Skills
- Object-oriented PHP
- MySQL
- MVC
- Frameworks
    - Laravel
    - Slim modified for MVC
    - Some Kohana use
- M/WAMP
- Template Engines
- SSH
- API Usage

## I use tools
I'm also proficient with multiple productivity and automation tools to
streamline the development process.

- Git
- Grunt
- Gulp
- npm
- Bower
- Composer

---

## I Have Experience
I have 7 years of working development experience under my belt, in which time
I've taught myself a plethora of skills and developed a wide array of websites,
including simple landing pages, informational websites, conversion-focused
product microsites, custom CRMs and in-house reporting tools.

I have solid experience working in tandem with marketing and design teams to
develop an idea from conception to completion, providing a unique insight thanks
to the combination of my technical and marketing knowledge.

### Rethink Media (2017 - Present)
I joined Rethink Media as a web developer in January 2017 and quickly worked my
way up to a senior position after proving myself to be an invaluable addition to
the team. In my time at Rethink I have been responsible for the development of a
newly redesigned company website, bringing it up to speed with full
cross-device responsiveness and performance improvements to both the back and
front end of the website, as well as working on websites and responsive emails
for several marketing campaigns.

I've also been responsible for a large amount of work on the companyâ€™s
custom-built Web-to-print platform, which combines e-commerce development with
heavy use of an API created by Xerox to interact with their FreeFlow Core
platform to send online print jobs directly to press.

I have affected several management and workflow improvements to the company,
including introducing version control with Git and Bitbucket, using Slack for
better communication, and the adoption of Asana for better task management and
time tracking.

### One Digital (2015 - 2017)
Myself and a few friends founded an online marketing & lead generation
company in late 2015, where I've worked as the Head of Development since.
During my time at One Digital I was primarily been responsible for the rapid
development and upkeep of several lead generation websites and landing pages.

I regularly took part in meetings to help determine new marketing campaigns and
then go on to build the necessary websites and tools to put these ideas into
practice, utilising a combination of the team's marketing knowledge and my own
technical expertise to create effective, engaging websites.

I was also responsible for leading a team of 2 junior developers for a short
period. I helped the new employees integrate into our team and set up a working
development environment, as well as introducing a development flow using Git
and Bitbucket, taking advantage of the issue tracker to record progress and
assign tasks.

### A Shade Greener (2011 - 2015)
In the 4 years prior I worked at A Shade Greener, a free solar panel
installation company. I took on a variety of assignments working on several
websites across the A Shade Greener family and played a vital role in the
company.

I was responsible for maintaining and updating all websites across the ASG
family, as well as taking part in weekly marketing meetings to contribute to
upcoming marketing ideas. I worked with the Managing Director, Marketing
Manager and Design Team to come up with ideas to increase customer
applications, ultimately growing A Shade Greener into the UK's largest
installer of free solar panels.

In addition to creating new websites I was also responsible for maintaining the
customer login & readings system and assisted in streamlining various other
internal processes. I created an error alert system to quickly inform me of any
problems occurring in the system, set up an automated email to inform customers
of the performance of their solar panel systems, ran database queries to obtain
targeted marketing data, and created a script which reduced a 2-day long manual
data entry process into an hour-long process which could be completed with just
a few clicks.

Working on a number of ongoing projects meant teamwork and time management were
essential. I worked with a junior developer to assign tasks appropriately and
ensure work was completed to deadlines, utilising Git for version control and
Bitbucket for code collaboration.

## I'm a [Real Human Being](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSVDcw6iW8)
When I'm not coding I spend most of my time having fun with my 2 beautiful
daughters, playing videos games, listening to music or trawling the internet
for the latest tech news, science updates and stuff that's generally
interesting to read or watch.

I have an unhealthy obsession with watches and I'm slowly building a vinyl
record collection.
