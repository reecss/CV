# Hi, I'm Reece.

I'm a full stack web developer from Barnsley, South Yorkshire with 10 years of
professional experience. I have an unbounded desire to learn new skills and
constantly improve and expand my skillset to make websites that are a pleasure
to experience and use.

In my career I've progressed from an in-house junior developer to a
senior position with the responsibility and trust to make technical project
decisions and produce proposals for client work. During this time I've taught
myself every aspect of web development, from the server to the browser.

---

## I Do Front-end
I strive to write fast, clean, semantic HTML5 backed up with responsive CSS3
style enhancements which gracefully fall back to working solutions in older
browsers. I write modular, structured BEM-style CSS compiled with Sass, and
have knowledge of using and customising several CSS frameworks to fit beskpoke
designs.

And what good is a fancy looking website without a little user interaction? I'm
proficient with JavaScript, whether in the form of frameworks including
Vue and React, vanilla Javascript, or jQuery.

### Skills
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Sass
- JavaScript
- Vue.js
- React
- Responsive Emails

## I Do Back-end
As well as being adept at front-end development, I'm well-versed in writing
server code with PHP. I've been responsible for database schema design,
file architecture and writing the majority of back-end code for most of the
projects I've worked on.

I work with object-oriented PHP on a daily basis - both in standard format and
using the Symfony and Laravel frameworks - writing DRY, abstracted code which
is well commented and meets PSR-12 standards, so it's easy to read and simple
to refactor.

### Skills
- Object-oriented PHP
- MySQL
- MVC
- Symfony & Laravel frameworks
- API Usage

## I Have Experience
During my 10 years of development experience I've taught myself a plethora of
skills and created a wide array of websites, including landing pages,
informational websites, conversion-focused product microsites, custom CRMs and
in-house reporting tools.

I have solid experience working in tandem with marketing and design teams to
develop ideas from conception to completion, providing a unique insight thanks
to my combination of technical and marketing knowledge.

### Etico Group (2018 - Present)
I've been a web developer at Etico Group since September 2018, where
I am responsible for the full development stack and major tech decisions.

Soon after joining, I set out to make improvements to the aging codebase of the
company's websites, making a number of changes to improve maintainability and
security across the board.

A large part of my work includes the rapid development and upkeep of lead
generation websites and landing pages under a number of different company brands.
Since these sites generally interact with a CRM, I built a custom PHP library
to remove repeated boilerplate code across sites and make using the API
simpler.

Another major focus is a custom-built internal system made with Laravel & Vue,
which houses a number of tools used by the company's employees to augment and
simplify common workflows and processes such as gathering customer data and
preparing business documents.

I've also worked on several non-web-related projects including multiple server
migrations (with no downtime), using elements of data science with Python and
the pandas library to create highly targeted audiences for products,
and writing a Python/Selenium script to simulate repetitive user actions in an
headless Chrome client.


### Rethink Media (2017 - 2018)
I joined Rethink Media as a web developer in January 2017 and quickly worked my
way up to a senior position after proving myself to be an invaluable addition to
the team.

In my time at Rethink I developed a newly redesigned company website, bringing
it up to speed with full cross-device responsiveness and performance
improvements to both the back and front end of the website, as well as working
on websites and responsive emails for several marketing campaigns.

I was also responsible for a large amount of work on the companyâ€™s
custom-built Web-to-print platform, which combined e-commerce development with
heavy use of an API created by Xerox to interact with their FreeFlow Core
platform to send online print jobs directly to press.

### One Digital (2015 - 2017)
A few friends and I founded an online marketing & lead generation company in
late 2015, where I was the Head of Development.

As well as general web development responsibilities, I led a team of 2 junior
developers for a short period. I helped the new employees integrate into our
team and set up a working development environment, as well as introducing a
development flow using Git and Bitbucket, utilising an issue tracker to record
progress and assign tasks.

### A Shade Greener (2011 - 2015)
In the 4 years prior I worked at A Shade Greener, a free solar panel
installation company. I took on a variety of assignments working on several
websites across the A Shade Greener family and played a vital role in the
company.

I was responsible for maintaining and updating all websites across the ASG
family, working with the Managing Director, Marketing Manager and Design Team
to produce marketing campaigns and increase customer applications, ultimately
growing A Shade Greener into the UK's largest installer of free solar panels.

I also maintained the customer login & readings system and assisted in
streamlining various other internal processes. I created an error alert system
to quickly inform me of any problems occurring in the system, and set up an
automated email to inform customers of the performance of their solar panel
systems.

## I'm a [Real Human Being](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSVDcw6iW8)
When I'm not coding I spend most of my time having fun with my 2 beautiful
daughters, playing video games, listening to music or trawling the internet
for the latest tech news, science updates and stuff that's generally
interesting to read or watch.

I'm slowly building a vinyl record collection and I'm currently having a go at
learning Spanish.
